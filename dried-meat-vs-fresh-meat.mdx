Choosing meat ingredients in dry cat food, such as fresh, dried, and meat meals, is crucial in determining its nutritional value and the resulting score based on established evaluation criteria. Commercial dried meat samples show varying pH levels due to different drying methods, significantly impacting meat quality, storage, and consumption.

Below is a detailed examination of these different meat forms: fresh, dehydrated, and meals - highlighting their impact on the scoring system and providing specific brand examples to demonstrate key insights.

## Fresh Meat Ingredients

### What Are Fresh Meats in Cat Food?
Fresh meats on [cat food labels](https://catfoodcentral.co/guide-to-guaranteed-analysis-for-dry-cat-food/) are typically listed as “chicken,” “beef,” “turkey,” or other specific animal sources without additional qualifiers. These meats are considered fresh because they undergo minimal processing before being added to the food.

### Why Are Fresh Meats Valued in Cat Food?
Fresh meats are highly valued for their high water content, natural flavor, and quality protein. They provide essential amino acids in natural ratios, which are crucial for a cat’s health. Additionally, fresh meats offer high bioavailability, meaning their nutrients are easily absorbed and utilized by a cat’s body.

### What Should I Consider When Choosing Cat Food with Fresh Meat?
While fresh meats are excellent protein sources, their high water content (typically 70-80%) can be misleading on ingredient lists.

It is important to note that fresh meat consists of approximately 70% water, which impacts its weight and position on ingredient lists after processing.

During manufacturing, the water is removed, reducing the weight of the fresh meat and potentially moving it lower on the ingredient list than it initially appeared.

### How Do Fresh Meats Affect Cat Food Quality Scores?
Listing fresh whole poultry or fish as the primary ingredient can significantly boost a food’s score. The scoring system awards:

- +2 points for these ingredients in the first place

- +1 point when they appear in the second or third position

### Examples of Fresh Meats in Cat Food:
- **Fresh Chicken:** “Brand A’s Fresh Chicken Formula for Cats” lists fresh chicken as its first ingredient, contributing to a high rating due to its digestibility and nutrient density. Fresh chicken helps maintain natural flavors and essential nutrients.

- **Fresh Salmon:** “Brand E’s Salmon Feast Cat Food” prominently features fresh salmon. This ingredient provides a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids and enhances the food’s nutritional value and palatability for cats.

- **Fresh Turkey:** “Brand F’s Turkey Delight Cat Kibble” uses fresh turkey as the top ingredient. Fresh turkey offers lean protein supporting muscle maintenance and overall health, benefiting scoring systems prioritizing high-quality animal proteins.

## Dehydrated Meat Ingredients and Meat Drying Process

### What Are Dehydrated Meat Ingredients in Dry Cat Food?
Dehydrated meats are made by removing moisture from fresh meat at a low temperature, preserving most of the meat’s nutritional properties. The meat drying process involves removing moisture from fresh meat at a low temperature, which helps preserve its nutritional properties. Examples include “dehydrated chicken” or “dehydrated salmon.”

Vacuum drying is an advanced drying technique that operates at low temperatures and without oxygen, helping preserve sensitive and oxidizable components.

### Why Are Dehydrated Meats Good for Cats?
Dehydrated meats are high-quality protein sources, retaining most amino acids and nutrients found in fresh meat.
Temperature and drying period are crucial factors that influence dehydrated meats’ quality and nutritional value.
Freeze drying minimizes the loss of vitamins and proteins, suggesting that it maintains the quality of dried meat better than conventional drying methods.
Dehydration concentrates the protein content, making it an efficient source of dry cat foods. These foods are less processed than meat meals and often contain fewer preservatives.
The dried meat’s chemical composition is preserved during dehydration, ensuring that essential nutrients remain intact.

### Do Dehydrated Meats Improve Dry Cat Food Quality Scores?
Yes, dehydrated meats score highly due to their concentrated nutritional value. They receive:

- +4 points for being the first ingredient

- +3 points for the second position

- +2 points for positions 3rd to 4th

**Examples of Dehydrated Meat in Dry Cat Food:**

- **Dehydrated Chicken:** Provides a concentrated protein source. For example, “Brand B’s Dehydrated Chicken Meal” uses dehydrated chicken as the primary ingredient, scoring high for its nutritional density.

- **Dehydrated Duck:** Offers essential nutrients while managing food sensitivities. “Brand G’s Duck Recipe for Cats” features dehydrated duck as a novel protein source.

- **Dehydrated Fish:** Rich in protein and essential fatty acids, promoting skin and coat health. “Brand H’s Ocean Fish Mix” includes dehydrated fish among its top ingredients.

## Meat Meals

### What Are Meat Meals in Cat Food?
Meat meals, like “chicken meal” or “fish meal,” are rendered products made from animal tissues. Multiple meat drying methods, including rendering and dehydration, can be used to produce meat meals.
The rendering process involves cooking the material to remove moisture and fat, producing a concentrated protein powder.

### Is Meat Meal a Good Source of Protein for Cats?
Yes, meat meals are richer in protein per unit weight than fresh meats because the moisture is removed. Traditional thermal drying techniques are often used in the rendering process, which can affect the nutritional quality of the resulting meat meal.
This makes them a potent and concentrated protein source, which can benefit dry cat foods.

### What Should I Consider When Choosing Cat Food with Meat Meal?
The quality of meat meals can vary greatly depending on the source of the ingredients and the rendering process. High-quality meat meals specify the source (e.g., “chicken meal” instead of generic “meat meal”) and are controlled for quality.
However, they can be less digestible than fresh or dehydrated meats because high-temperature processing can denature some proteins, making them harder for cats to utilize.

### How Does Meat Meal Affect Cat Food Quality Scores?
Cat foods using meat meals as the primary protein source generally receive lower scores. Using main meat by-product ingredients leads to significant point deductions in quality evaluation systems.

**Examples of Meat Meals in Cat Food:**

- **Chicken Meal:** For instance, “Brand C’s Chicken Meal Formula” uses chicken meal as its main protein source. While it provides a significant amount of protein and is less expensive, it scores lower due to the heavy processing involved.

- **Fish Meal:** “Brand I’s Deep Sea Fish Meal Cat Food” includes fish meal rich in protein and omega-3. However, the meal form indicates more processing and potentially lower freshness, negatively impacting its score compared to fresher options.

- **Lamb Meal:** “Brand J’s Lamb Meal Mix for Senior Cats” uses lamb meal to provide sustained energy for older cats. Though lamb meal is packed with protein, it may contain less desirable animal parts, resulting in a lower score in systems that favor whole, fresh meats.

## AAFCO and FEDIAF Meat Definitions

The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and the European Pet Food Industry Federation (FEDIAF) provide guidelines and definitions for the various forms of meat used in cat food.

**AAFCO Definitions:**

- **[Meat](https://www.petfoodinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Table-1.pdf):** Defined as the clean flesh derived from slaughtered mammals, limited to skeletal muscle or that found in the tongue, diaphragm, heart, or esophagus.
- **[Meat Meal](https://www.petfoodinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Table-1.pdf):** A rendered product from mammal tissues, excluding added blood, hair, hoof, horn, hide trimmings, manure, stomach, and rumen contents, except in trace amounts.

**FEDIAF Guidelines:**

[FEDIAF guidelines](https://europeanpetfood.org/pet-food-facts/ingredients/) state that meats are generally good sources of protein, essential fatty acids, iron, and some B-group vitamins. They also increase a product's palatability and are highly digestible.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are there any specific health conditions in cats that benefit more from fresh, dehydrated, or meat meals?

Cats with specific dietary needs, such as those with sensitivities or allergies, may benefit more from fresh or dehydrated meats due to their higher quality and natural nutrient content.
For instance, the pH levels of dried and fresh biltong are critical for meat quality and can influence the dietary benefits for cats with specific health conditions.
Meat meals can be suitable for cats requiring a concentrated protein source, but the processing may reduce digestibility for some cats, making them less ideal for those with digestive sensitivities.

### How can I identify high-quality meat meals in cat food ingredient lists?

High-quality meat meals will specify the source, such as “chicken meal” or “salmon meal,” rather than using generic terms like “meat meal” or “animal meal.”
Drying conditions can also influence the quality of meat meals, as ground-dried meat's moisture content and water activity decline with increased drying periods and temperatures.
Additionally, the ingredient should be listed as one of the first few ingredients, indicating a higher proportion in the food. Avoid products that list “by-products” or “animal digest” as primary ingredients, as these can be lower in quality.

### Do fresh meats or meat meals impact the shelf life of dry cat food differently?

Yes, meat meals generally have a longer shelf life than fresh meats due to their lower moisture content and processing methods.
Dried or dehydrated meat, on the other hand, offers a balanced shelf life and preserved nutritional value due to moisture removal.
While fresh meats offer higher bioavailability and natural nutrients, they may require more careful storage to maintain freshness and prevent spoilage. Dehydrated meats, on the other hand, offer a balanced shelf life and preserve nutritional value.

### How is the protein concentration of freeze-dried meat produced compared to fresh meat in dry cat food?

Dehydrated meats have a higher protein concentration than fresh meats because the dehydration removes most of the water content, leaving behind a more concentrated protein source.
Additionally, the drying process can enhance enzyme activity, producing free amino acids and fatty acids, which are then oxidized to produce aroma-volatile compounds, influencing the sensory attributes of the meat.
Fresh meats contain more water, so while they are naturally rich in nutrients, their protein percentage is lower by weight when compared to dehydrated meat.

### How do fresh, dehydrated, and meat meals using traditional thermal drying techniques compare in terms of cost in dry cat food?

Due to their high quality and natural state, fresh meats are generally more expensive, while dehydrated meats offer a concentrated protein source at a moderate cost.
Meat meals are typically the most cost-effective option, but this affordability can sometimes come at the expense of quality and digestibility.

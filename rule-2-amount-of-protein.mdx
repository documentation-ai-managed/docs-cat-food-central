## Baseline for Protein Content

This is based on the fact that cats are obligate carnivores and that their natural diet in the wild consists primarily of animal prey, which contains approximately 50% dry-matter protein.

## Points Deduction for Protein Content Below the Baseline

For every 1% of dry matter protein below the 50% baseline, 1 point is deducted from the food's score. The calculation is as follows:

Points deducted = 50 - (Dry matter protein %)

For example, if a dry cat food contains 36% dry matter protein, the points deducted would be:

50 - 36 = 14 points deducted

## Importance of High Protein Content for Obligate Carnivores

As obligate carnivores, cats have specific nutritional requirements that are best met by a diet high in animal-based proteins. A diet rich in high-quality protein is essential for cats for several reasons:

1. **Body Maintenance and Repair**: Proteins are the building blocks for muscles, enzymes, hormones, and other vital body components. Cats require a constant supply of high-quality protein to maintain and repair their body tissues.

2. **Energy Source**: In addition to being the primary source of amino acids, protein is also an important source of energy for cats. When carbohydrates and fats are insufficient or unavailable, proteins can be metabolized to provide energy.

3. **Amino Acid Requirements**: Cats have specific amino acid requirements that can only be met through the consumption of animal-based proteins. Plant-based proteins often lack certain essential amino acids or have an imbalanced amino acid profile, making them an incomplete source of protein for cats.

4. **Lean Body Mass**: A high-protein diet helps cats maintain lean body mass and prevents muscle wasting, which is particularly important for active or senior cats.

5. **Satiety and Weight Management**: Protein is more satiating than carbohydrates or fats, which can help cats feel fuller for longer and support healthy weight management.

By ensuring a high protein content in dry cat food, preferably from animal-based sources, cat owners can provide their feline companions with the essential nutrients they need to thrive and maintain optimal health and well-being.

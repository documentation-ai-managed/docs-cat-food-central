## Overview of the Scoring Method

The scoring method assigns points to each dry cat food based on predefined rules. These rules take into account three main criteria:

1. **Amount of Protein**: Higher protein content is favored, as cats are obligate carnivores and require a diet rich in animal-based proteins.

2. **Amount of Carbohydrates**: Lower carbohydrate content is preferred, as cats cannot digest and utilize carbohydrates efficiently.

3. **Quality and Source of Ingredients**: The quality and origin of the ingredients, particularly meat and fat sources, are evaluated, with higher points awarded for more desirable and high-quality ingredients.

The maximum attainable score is 100 points, either deducted or added based on the specific rules and calculations outlined in the methodology.

## The Purpose

The primary purpose of this scoring method is to provide a standardized, objective means of comparing dry cat foods based solely on their ingredients and nutritional composition. By focusing on these factors, the methodology aims to identify the most suitable options for cats' unique dietary requirements as obligate carnivores.

<Card title="Example" icon="cat" horizontal="true" target="_self">
  A cat parent can use this scoring system to compare two dry cat foods, Brand A and Brand B, and determine which one has a higher score, indicating a more appropriate formulation for their cat's nutritional needs.
</Card>

## The Criteria

The scoring method evaluates dry cat foods based on three main criteria:

1. **Protein Amount**: Dry cat foods with higher protein content, preferably from animal-based sources, receive higher scores. The baseline is set at 50% dry matter protein, which aligns with a cat's natural diet in the wild.

   <Card title="Example: Protein Amount" icon="lucide-egg" horizontal="true" target="_self">
     A dry cat food with 60% dry matter protein would receive a higher score than one with 40% dry matter protein, as it provides a more protein-rich diet for an obligate carnivore.
   </Card>



2. **Carbohydrate Amount**: Lower carbohydrate content is favored, as cats cannot digest and utilize carbohydrates efficiently. The baseline is set at 5% dry matter carbohydrates, reflecting the minimal carbohydrate intake in a cat's natural diet.

   <Card title="Example: Carbohydrate Amount" horizontal="true" target="_self">
     A dry cat food with 20% dry matter carbohydrates would receive a lower score than one with 10% dry matter carbohydrates, as the latter more closely aligns with a cat's natural dietary requirements.
   </Card>



3. **Quality and Source of Ingredients**: The methodology evaluates ingredient quality and sourcing, particularly meat and fat. Higher scores are awarded for whole, fresh, or minimally processed animal-based ingredients, while lower scores are given for by-products, plant-based proteins, and unspecified or unknown sources.

   <Card title="Example: Source of Ingredients" icon="lucide-list-ordered" horizontal="true" target="_self">
     A dry cat food containing fresh chicken as the main ingredient would receive a higher score than one with chicken by-product meal or plant-based protein sources as the primary ingredients.
   </Card>

## Exclusions

It is important to note that this scoring method focuses solely on the ingredients and nutritional composition of dry cat foods. Factors such as:

- Taste

- Price

- Availability

- Origin

- Brand history\
  are not considered.

The methodology aims to evaluate the nutritional quality and suitability of a cat's dietary needs as an obligate carnivore.

<Card title="Example" horizontal="true" target="_self">
  Two dry cat foods with identical ingredient lists and nutritional values would receive the same score, regardless of their price point, brand reputation, or country of origin.
</Card>

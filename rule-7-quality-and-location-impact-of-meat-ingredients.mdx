title: 'Rule 7: Quality and Location Impact of Meat Ingredients'
description: >-
  This rule awards points based on the presence and position of high-quality,
  fresh, or minimally processed meat and fish ingredients in the ingredient
  list.
---
However, an additional factor of "relocation" needs to be considered for fresh meat and fish ingredients.

## Points Addition for Fresh or Minimally Processed Meat Ingredients

1. **Fresh Whole Poultry or Fish**:

- At the 1st place in the ingredient list: +2 points

- At the 2nd or 3rd place in the ingredient list: +1 point

2. **Fresh Poultry Meat or Fish Meat**:

- At the 1st place in the ingredient list: +3 points

- At the 2nd or 3rd place in the ingredient list: +2 points

3. **Dehydrated Poultry or Fish**:

- At the 1st place in the ingredient list: +4 points

- At the 2nd place in the ingredient list: +3 points

- At the 3rd or 4th place in the ingredient list: +2 points

## Relocation Factor for Fresh Meat and Fish Ingredients

Fresh meat and fish ingredients contain a significant amount of water (70-80%), which is removed during the food-making process. As a result, their actual weight or proportion in the final product is unknown. To account for this, a relocation factor is applied to determine the appropriate position of these ingredients for scoring purposes.

The relocation factor is based on the following assumptions:

1. The weight of fresh meat or fish ingredients does not exceed 30% of the food's total weight.

2. After drying, with an average residual moisture of 10%, the weight of these ingredients is approximately 9-12% of the food's total weight.

3. The weight of the main fat ingredient in a non-diet food is also around 10-12% of the food's total weight.

The relocation process works as follows:

1. Identify the position of the fresh meat or fish ingredient in the ingredient list.

2. Locate the first main fat ingredient in the list.

3. Relocate the fresh meat or fish ingredient to the position immediately after the main fat ingredient.

For example, if a food has the following ingredients:
"Fresh chicken, chicken meal, peas, rice, chicken fat…"

The fresh chicken would usually be awarded 2 points for being in first place. However, since chicken fat (the main fat ingredient) is listed after it, for the sake of the score calculation, the fresh chicken is "relocated" to first place after chicken fat to reflect its "true" weight as an ingredient.

### Explanation

The inclusion of fresh, whole, or minimally processed meat and fish ingredients is generally preferred in cat food formulations for several reasons:

1. **Nutrient Density**: Fresh and whole meat sources are more nutrient-dense, containing a higher concentration of essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals compared to highly processed or rendered ingredients.

2. **Digestibility**: Less processed ingredients are typically more easily digestible for cats, as the natural structure and composition of the proteins and other nutrients are better preserved.

3. **Palatability**: Fresh and whole meat sources are often more palatable and appealing to cats, as they retain their natural flavors and aromas.

4. **Quality Control**: Fresh and whole ingredients are subject to stricter quality control measures, reducing the risk of contamination or adulteration.

5. **Minimal Processing**: Highly processed or rendered ingredients may undergo harsh treatments, such as high temperatures or the use of solvents, which can degrade or denature some of the valuable nutrients.

By awarding points for the presence and higher positioning of these high-quality meat and fish ingredients, this rule encourages pet food manufacturers to prioritize fresh, whole, and minimally processed animal-based proteins in their formulations, better aligning with a cat's natural dietary requirements as an obligate carnivore.

The relocation factor accounts for the weight loss during the drying process of fresh meat and fish ingredients, ensuring that their scoring accurately reflects their presence and relative importance in the final product.

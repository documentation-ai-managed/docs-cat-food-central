title: 'Rule 6: Additional Source of Animal Protein'
description: >-
  This rule awards points for the presence of an additional source of animal
  protein in the ingredients list, based on its position relative to the main
  meat.
---
However, the additional source must belong to a category different from the main meat ingredient.

The categories for animal protein sources are:

1. Poultry (chicken, turkey, etc.)

2. Mammal meat (beef, lamb, etc.)

3. Fish

4. Eggs

5. Seafood

## Points Addition for Additional Animal Protein Source

1. **Additional Animal Protein from a Different Category at 2nd-3rd Places**:

- If an additional source of animal protein from a different category than the main meat ingredient is listed in 2nd or 3rd place after the main meat ingredient, 4 points are added to the food's score.

2. **Additional Animal Protein from a Different Category at 4th-5th Places**:

- If an additional source of animal protein from a different category is listed in 4th or 5th place after the main meat ingredient, 2 points are added to the food's score.

3. **Additional Animal Protein from a Different Category at 6th-7th Places**:

- If an additional source of animal protein from a different category is listed at the 6th or 7th place after the main meat ingredient, 1 point is added to the food's score.

This rule applies only to one additional source of animal protein per food. Only the highest-ranking one (based on position) is considered if multiple additional sources are present.

## Examples

1. A dry cat food with the following ingredients:
   "Chicken meal, brown rice, peas, herring meal…"

- Herring meal is an additional source of animal protein (fish category) listed at the 4th place after the main meat ingredient (chicken meal from the poultry category).

- According to the rule, 2 points would be added to the food's score.

2. A dry cat food with the following ingredients: "Lamb meal, peas, rice, egg product, flaxseed…"

- Egg product is an additional source of animal protein (egg category) listed at the 4th place after the main meat ingredient (lamb meal from the mammal meat category).

- According to the rule, 2 points would be added to the food's score.

3. A dry cat food with the following ingredients: "Chicken, chicken meal, peas, beef meal, oatmeal…"

- Beef meal is an additional source of animal protein (mammal meat category) listed in 4th place after the main meat ingredient (chicken from the poultry category).

- However, chicken meal (also from the poultry category) is listed before beef meal, so it would not be considered an additional source from a different category.

- No points would be added to the food's score in this case.

By awarding points for an additional source of animal protein from a different category, this rule encourages the inclusion of multiple high-quality protein sources in cat food formulations, providing a wider variety of amino acid profiles for optimal nutrition.

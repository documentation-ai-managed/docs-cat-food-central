## TL;DR

If you are considering Nutrience, this page gives you a clear overview of what to expect. The brand divides its dry cat food into three ranges with different focuses. SubZero mixes kibble with freeze-dried meat pieces for higher protein and stronger taste, often suiting active or selective cats. Grain Free uses peas and sweet potatoes instead of cereals, which can help if your cat does not do well on grains, and it also comes in an Indoor version for lower activity cats. Original keeps rice and oatmeal for steady energy and balanced nutrition, a straightforward choice for everyday feeding when grains are well tolerated.

## About the Brand

[Nutrience](https://nutrience.com/nutrience-for-cats/dry-food/?product_type_nc=11&food_type=276) was founded in 1955 and remains family-owned today. All of its foods are made in its own kitchen in British Columbia, Canada. Production is done in small batches, and the facility is certified to SQF Level 3, the highest food safety standard. The recipes use locally sourced ingredients wherever possible. The name combines “nutrition” and “science,” reflecting a focus on evidence-based formulation and quality control. With nearly seventy years of history, Nutrience has become one of the established Canadian makers of premium dry cat food.

## [SubZero Line](https://catfoodcentral.co/brand/nutrience-sub-zero/) - Freeze Dried Inclusions for Palatability

![nutrience-subzero-logo](https://catfoodcentral.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/subzero-logo-300x3001-1-e1687663994775.webp)

### What this line is

SubZero pairs kibble with freeze-dried chicken liver and fish pieces. These inclusions raise aroma and flavor, which can encourage cats that are selective about food.

### Ingredient system

- Multiple animal proteins, including poultry, red meats, and fish, broaden amino acid coverage.
- Green peas and red lentils supply carbohydrate energy, fiber, and some plant protein.
- Salmon oil contributes omega-3 fatty acids for skin and coat health.
- Chicken fat provides calorie-dense energy.
- Freeze-dried beef liver or fish inclusions increase palatability.

### Why it matters

- High calorie density works well for active, outdoor, or younger cats.
- Freeze-dried inclusions help persuade picky eaters.
- Multi-protein blends may not be ideal if your cat has targeted sensitivities.

### Key Takeaway

SubZero delivers strong taste and higher protein, fitting active cats or those that need extra calories, but requires careful portion control indoors.

## [Grain-Free Line](https://catfoodcentral.co/brand/nutrience-grain-free/) - Legumes and Sweet Potatoes Instead of Grains

![NUTRIENCE-Grain_free_logo](https://catfoodcentral.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NUTRIENCE-Grain_free_logo-e1687666226737.webp)

### What this line is

[Grain-Free](https://catfoodcentral.co/kb-article/grain-free-dry-cat-food-15-questions-answered/) removes cereals like rice or corn and replaces them with legumes and tubers. It includes an Indoor option with lower fat and more fiber.

### Ingredient system

- Green peas, lentils, and sweet potatoes replace grains as the main carbohydrate sources.
- Salmon oil and coconut oil support palatability and fatty acid intake.
- Fruits and vegetables such as pumpkin, cranberries, spinach, and chicory root extract appear in small amounts as antioxidants and fiber aids.
- Indoor variant reduces fat while increasing fiber.

### Why it matters

- Suitable for cats that react poorly to grains.
- Grain-free does not mean carbohydrate-free; legumes and tubers still provide energy.
- Some cats may struggle with legume-based formulas, producing bulkier stools.
- Indoor recipe helps manage calories and hairballs while keeping meal size reasonable.

### Key Takeaway

Grain Free suits cats that cannot tolerate grains and includes a specific Indoor formula, though tolerance to legumes should be monitored.

## [Original Line](https://catfoodcentral.co/brand/nutrience-original/) - With Grains for Steady Energy

![](https://catfoodcentral.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nutrience_Original_Logo.webp)

### What this line is

Original uses traditional grains such as brown rice and oatmeal. These provide steady energy release and predictable digestion, along with moderate amounts of protein and fat.

### Ingredient system

- Chicken meal is the lead protein.
- Brown rice and oatmeal supply digestible carbohydrates and soluble fiber.
- Salmon oil and flaxseed contribute essential fatty acids.
- Supplements such as vitamin e supplement, calcium carbonate, folic acid, and sun cured alfalfa meal are included for nutritional balance.
- Mineral premixes combine zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, and sodium selenite with chelated forms like zinc proteinate.

### Why it matters

- Balanced protein and fat levels make it suitable for daily adult feeding.
- Grain-inclusive diets often support compact, predictable stools.
- Less aromatic than SubZero, which can affect acceptance in selective cats.

### Key Takeaway

Original is a reliable option for cats that tolerate grains and need steady, moderate nutrition.

## How to Choose Between Them

Think about how your cat lives day to day. If your cat is active, young, or tends to lose weight, SubZero’s high protein and palatability usually make it the best match.

If your cat spends most of the day indoors and has lower activity, the Indoor recipes in Grain Free or Original are more suitable. They add fiber to help with hairballs and reduce fat to aid in weight management.

For cats that don’t do well on grains, Grain Free is the natural option. Keep in mind that while it avoids cereals, it still contains peas and lentils, so check digestion during the switch.

If poultry causes problems, Canadian Pacific and Ocean Fish are clear non-poultry formulas that simplify feeding.

And if your cat does well on steady, predictable diets, the Original line with rice and oatmeal provides balanced nutrition without surprises.

This rule awards points for the presence of chelated minerals in the ingredients list of dry cat food.

## Points Addition for Chelated Minerals

If chelated minerals are listed as an ingredient, 2 points are added to the food's score.

## Explanation of the Benefits of Chelated Minerals

Minerals are essential nutrients required for various physiological processes in cats, such as bone formation, enzyme function, and metabolic regulation. However, not all mineral sources are equally bioavailable or easily absorbed by the body.

Chelated minerals are minerals that are chemically bonded to amino acids or other organic molecules, forming a stable complex called a chelate. This chelation process enhances the bioavailability and absorption of minerals in the following ways:

1. **Increased Solubility**: Chelated minerals are more soluble in the digestive tract, making them easier for the body to absorb and utilize.
2. **Improved Stability**: The chelation process protects minerals from forming insoluble complexes with other compounds in the digestive tract, which can reduce their absorption.
3. **Enhanced Absorption**: Chelated minerals are more readily absorbed through the intestinal wall due to increased solubility and stability.
4. **Targeted Delivery**: Chelated minerals can be more efficiently transported and delivered to specific tissues and organs where they are needed.

By improving the bioavailability and absorption of essential minerals, chelated mineral sources can help ensure that cats receive adequate amounts of these nutrients, even when consuming a diet with lower mineral levels. This can support various physiological functions, such as bone health, immune function, and overall metabolic processes.

### Examples of Chelated Minerals

Common examples of chelated minerals found in high-quality cat foods include:

- Zinc proteinate or zinc chelate
- Iron proteinate or iron chelate
- Copper proteinate or copper chelate
- Manganese proteinate or manganese chelate
- Selenium yeast (a chelated form of selenium)

These chelated mineral sources are often listed in the ingredient list with the specific mineral name followed by the chelating agent, such as "zinc proteinate" or "iron proteinate."

This rule encourages pet food manufacturers to use more bioavailable and easily absorbed mineral sources by awarding points for the inclusion of chelated minerals. This can contribute to better overall nutrient utilization and health in cats.

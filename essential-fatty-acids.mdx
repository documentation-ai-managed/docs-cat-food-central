title: Essential Fatty Acids
description: >-
  Essential fatty acids are types of fats crucial for various bodily functions
  but cannot be synthesized by the body itself, hence the term "essential."

They must be obtained through the diet. For cats, the two main essential fatty acids are Omega-3 and Omega-6.

## Omega-6 Fatty Acids

- The most important omega-6 fatty acid for cats is linoleic acid.

- Linoleic acid is involved in maintaining healthy skin and coat, as well as supporting reproductive health and normal growth and development.

## Omega-3 Fatty Acids

- The most important omega-3 fatty acids for cats are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

- Omega-3 fatty acids play a role in maintaining healthy skin and coat, supporting cognitive function, and promoting a healthy inflammatory response.

- DHA is particularly important for proper brain and eye development in kittens.

Since cats cannot produce essential fatty acids on their own, they must obtain them from their diet.
In the wild, cats would consume essential fatty acids by eating whole prey animals, which contain these nutrients in their tissues.

In commercial cat foods, sources of essential fatty acids include:

- **Animal-based Fats and Oils**: Ingredients like chicken fat, fish oil, and other animal-derived fats and oils are rich sources of both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids.

- **Plant-based Oils**: Certain plant-based oils, such as flaxseed oil and canola oil, can provide alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which can be converted to EPA and DHA in small amounts by cats.

It's important to note that cats cannot convert ALA to the more biologically active forms of EPA and DHA, making animal-based sources of these fatty acids more desirable in their diet.

Deficiencies in essential fatty acids can lead to various health issues in cats, such as dry, flaky skin, dull coat, reproductive problems, and impaired growth and development.
Therefore, ensuring an adequate intake of these nutrients through a balanced diet or supplementation is crucial for maintaining overall feline health and well-being.

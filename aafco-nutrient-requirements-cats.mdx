### Background and Role

The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) is a voluntary membership organization (U.S.) that sets standards for animal feeds and cat foods in the United States. AAFCO guidelines serve as a benchmark for cat food manufacturers, ensuring that their products meet the nutritional needs of various animal species, including cats.

### Nutrient Profiles for Complete and Balanced Nutrition in Cat Foods

AAFCO has established nutrient profiles that specify the minimum and maximum levels of essential nutrients required for complete and balanced cat foods. These profiles cover macronutrients like protein, fat, and carbohydrates, as well as essential vitamins and minerals. These profiles also emphasize the importance of essential amino acids, which are crucial for various bodily functions and must be obtained from animal-based proteins.

Kittens / Growth and Reproduction Nutrient Levels:

- Minimum 30% [crude protein](https://catfoodcentral.co/kb-article/crude-protein-in-dry-cat-food/)

- Minimum 9% [crude fat](https://catfoodcentral.co/kb-article/crude-fat-in-dry-cat-food/)

- Specific minimums for amino acids like arginine (1.04%), tryptophan (0.25%)

- Minimum [vitamin levels](https://catfoodcentral.co/kb-article/can-cats-take-vitamins/) like vitamin A (5,000 IU/kg), vitamin D (500 IU/kg)

- Minimum levels for minerals like calcium (1%), phosphorus (0.8%)

Vitamins like B12 are essential for fat and carbohydrate metabolism, ensuring that cats can efficiently utilize these macronutrients for energy.

Adult Maintenance:

- Minimum 26% crude protein

- Minimum 9% crude fat

- Lower minimums for some amino acids, vitamins, and minerals compared to the kitten profile

AAFCO does not have separate nutrient profiles for senior/mature cats or differentiate them based on activity levels.

### Feeding Trial Protocols

AAFCO has developed feeding trial protocols to substantiate claims of nutritional adequacy for cat foods. These protocols involve feeding the product to several animals over a predetermined period and monitoring their health and performance.

The feeding trial protocols aim to ensure that the cat food provides complete and balanced nutrition when fed as the sole source of nourishment. For cat foods, the trials typically involve feeding a group of cats the product for at least 26 weeks while monitoring their weight, body condition, and overall health.

### Pet Food Labels and Labeling Requirements

AAFCO has established labeling guidelines to ensure that cat food labels provide accurate and transparent information to consumers. A pet food label must provide accurate and transparent information to consumers, ensuring they understand the nutritional adequacy of the product.
AAFCO requires a guaranteed analysis statement for dry cat foods, which lists the minimum percentages of crude protein and fat and the maximum percentages of crude fiber and moisture. Additionally, the labels must include an ingredient list in descending order by weight and a statement of nutritional adequacy, such as “complete and balanced for adult maintenance.”

  ## Quality Score Experience Upgrade

  We redesigned the Quality Score widget on the dry cat food page and added a new “Understanding this score” modal.

  It now clearly shows what drives the score (added vs. deducted points) and adds context with a relative position indicator, so you can see where this food ranks within its group and how many products score higher or lower.

  We’ve added bag size information to dry cat food pages and introduced a new size filter (small, medium, bulk) in Advanced Search, so you can quickly find foods in the package sizes that fit your needs.

  ## **How Does It Work?**

  Our system selects alternative products based on key factors such as:\
  ✅ **Life Stage** – Ensuring the product is suitable for kittens, adults, or seniors.\
  ✅ **Category** – Matching specialized needs like regular, urinary health, or sterilized formulas.\
  ✅ **Protein Content** – Staying within a reasonable range of the viewed product.\
  ✅ **Fat & Fiber Levels** – Keeping comparisons nutritionally relevant.\
  ✅ **Overall Score** – Ensuring alternatives maintain a similar quality level.\
  ✅ **Metabolizable Energy** – Helping to find options with a comparable calorie profile.

  But that’s not all! **Want to explore even more options?**\
  Click/tap the **"Discover More Options"** box, and you’ll be redirected to our **Advanced Search** page, where you can browse additional products with the following pre-applied filters:\
  🔹 **Life Stage**\
  🔹 **Category**\
  🔹 **Crude Protein Range**\
  🔹 **Score Range**

  This feature is being **gradually rolled out**, so you might not see it on all products just yet. We’re continuously refining it to bring you the most relevant recommendations.

  ## **We’ve Been Quiet, But We Haven’t Stopped Working!**

  While we haven’t shared many updates lately, we’ve been hard at work behind the scenes, continuously improving Cat Food Central. Now, we’re excited to give you a recap of everything we’ve accomplished from April 2024 through February 2025!

  ### **New Products Added**

  In 2024, we analyzed and added **133 new dry cat foods** and **32 new brands** to our platform! Seeing Cat Food Central grow has been incredibly rewarding - especially since many of these additions came from your requests. Thank you for helping us make the platform even better!

  ### **November 2024: Advanced Search**

  In early November, we launched an **all-new advanced search**, making finding the right food for your cat easier than ever.\
  Cat Food Central is a data-driven platform designed to provide **clear, unbiased reviews** of dry cat foods. With this upgrade, you can now filter products by:\
  ✅ Brand\
  ✅ First ingredient type\
  ✅ Flavor\
  ✅ Grain-free status\
  ✅ Crude protein, fat, fiber, and carbs levels\
  ✅ Metabolizable energy

  This is a huge step toward expanding our capabilities, with more advanced features coming soon!

  ### **December 2024: Keeping Product Data Up to Date & Knowledge Center Access**

  Adding new products is essential, but keeping existing ones up to date is just as crucial. In December, we implemented **an advanced tracking system** that monitors recipe changes and updates product scores accordingly.

  On every product page, you’ll find a "Last Reviewed" date below the nutrition section so you always know how recent the data is. We’re still rolling this out across all products and expect full coverage by **summer 2025**.

  In December, we also introduced **quick access to the Knowledge Center** directly from the product page. Just tap the floating icon to find answers to your questions—we’re constantly adding new content!

  ### **January 2025: A More User-Friendly Product Page**

  We redesigned the product page to make navigation smoother and more intuitive.\
  You may have noticed that products now include **a summary with pros and cons**, which helps you quickly understand the key takeaways. Combined with our quality score, this gives you an even clearer picture of what you’re feeding your cat.

  ### **Ongoing Improvements: UI, UX, & Behind-the-Scenes Updates**

  Throughout these months, we’ve been making countless upgrades—big and small—to enhance the platform:\
  🔹 A better mobile menu\
  🔹 Updated fonts for improved readability\
  🔹 A refreshed blog layout\
  🔹 A more polished Knowledge Center\
  🔹 Under-the-hood performance improvements

  And much more!

  Thank you for being part of our journey.\
  We’re always working to improve Cat Food Central, and we can’t wait to share what’s next!

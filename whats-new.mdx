  ## 1300!

  We’ve passed a significant milestone: Cat Food Central now includes analysis of 1,300+ dry cat foods, each reviewed using our consistent, data-driven scoring approach to help cat parents compare options faster and with more confidence.

  ## Dry Cat Food page Facelift

  We gave the hero section on the dry cat food page a facelift: updated colors, refreshed icons, and improved layout so the key info is easier to read, better placed, and more modern.

  ## Quality Score Experience Upgrade

  We redesigned the Quality Score widget on the dry cat food page and added a new “Understanding this score” modal.

  It now clearly shows what drove the score (added vs. deducted points) and adds context with a relative position indicator - so you can see where this food ranks within its group, and how many products score higher or lower.

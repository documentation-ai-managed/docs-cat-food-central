<Update label="2025-09-11" description="quality score upgraded" tags={["enhancement"]}>
  ## Quality Score Experience Upgrade

  We redesigned the Quality Score widget on the dry cat food page and added a new “Understanding this score” modal.

  It now clearly shows what drives the score (added vs. deducted points) and adds context with a relative position indicator, so you can see where this food ranks within its group and how many products score higher or lower.

<Update label="2025-09-07" description="Size options" tags={["enhancement"]}>
  ## Bag Sizes & Size Filter

  We’ve added bag size information to dry cat food pages and introduced a new size filter (small, medium, bulk) in Advanced Search, so you can quickly find foods in the package sizes that fit your needs.

<Update label="2025-03-05" description="Alternative products" tags={["enhancement"]}>
  ## New! Alternative Products

  We’re excited to introduce a new feature on our platform - **Alternative Products**!

  When viewing a dry cat food, you’ll now see a dedicated section showcasing **nutritionally comparable options from other brands**.

  <Video uid="abfb995f-7e05-4605-b8df-c029447fa622" src="https://catfoodcentral.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/alternative_products_video.webm" render-type="video" width="560" height="315" autoplay="true" controls="false" allow-full-screen="true" style="width: 560px; height: auto; cursor: pointer; margin: 0 auto;" />

  ## **How Does It Work?**

  Our system selects alternative products based on key factors such as:\
  ✅ **Life Stage** – Ensuring the product is suitable for kittens, adults, or seniors.\
  ✅ **Category** – Matching specialized needs like regular, urinary health, or sterilized formulas.\
  ✅ **Protein Content** – Staying within a reasonable range of the viewed product.\
  ✅ **Fat & Fiber Levels** – Keeping comparisons nutritionally relevant.\
  ✅ **Overall Score** – Ensuring alternatives maintain a similar quality level.\
  ✅ **Metabolizable Energy** – Helping to find options with a comparable calorie profile.

  But that’s not all! **Want to explore even more options?**\
  Simply click/tap the **"Discover More Options"** box, and you’ll be redirected to our **Advanced Search** page, where you can browse additional products with the following pre-applied filters:\
  🔹 **Life Stage**\
  🔹 **Category**\
  🔹 **Crude Protein Range**\
  🔹 **Score Range**

  This feature is being **gradually rolled out**, so you might not see it on all products just yet. We’re continuously refining it to bring you the most relevant recommendations.

  🔍 **Try it now by exploring any dry cat food page!**

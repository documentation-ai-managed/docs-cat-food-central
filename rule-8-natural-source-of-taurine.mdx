## Points Addition for Natural Sources of Taurine

If a natural source of taurine appears in the ingredients list, 5 points are added to the food's score.

## Explanation of the Importance of Taurine in a Cat's Diet

Taurine is an essential amino acid that plays crucial roles in various physiological processes in cats. It is vital for:

1. **Vision and Eye Health**: Taurine is a key component of the retina and is necessary for normal vision and preventing retinal degeneration in cats.

2. **Cardiovascular Function**: Taurine helps regulate calcium levels in the heart muscle, preventing cardiomyopathy (a form of heart disease) in cats.

3. **Reproduction and Development**: Taurine is essential for proper fetal development and cat reproductive health.

4. **Bile Acid Conjugation**: Taurine is involved in the conjugation of bile acids, which aids in the digestion and absorption of fats.

Cats cannot synthesize sufficient amounts of taurine from other amino acids, making it an essential nutrient that must be obtained from their diet. Taurine deficiency can lead to various health issues, including blindness, heart disease, reproductive problems, and digestive issues.

### Examples of Natural Sources and Added Sources

Natural sources of taurine in cat food ingredients include:

- Fish and seafood (e.g., fish meal, herring meal, shrimp meal)

- Meat and meat by-products (e.g., chicken meal, beef meal, liver)

On the other hand, if taurine is listed as an added supplement or ingredient without specifying a natural source, it is not considered a natural source of taurine and won't qualify for the points addition under this rule.

By awarding points for including natural sources of taurine, this rule encourages pet food manufacturers to incorporate ingredients that provide this essential amino acid in a form that is more bioavailable and closer to a cat's natural diet.

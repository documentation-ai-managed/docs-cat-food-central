Cat Food Central helps cat owners make smarter decisions about dry cat food. We analyze hundreds of products and assign each an objective quality score based solely on its ingredients and nutritional composition.

No guesswork. No marketing spin. Just data.

<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  Cat Food Central covers **dry cat food only**. We score each product using a structured methodology built around what cats actually need as obligate carnivores - high protein, low carbohydrates, and quality animal-based ingredients.

## What you can do here

- **Browse and search** hundreds of dry cat food products

- **Understand what's actually in your cat's food** — beyond the marketing claims on the bag

- **Learn about feline nutrition** through our guides on protein, carbohydrates, ingredients, and more

## How the scores work

Every product is evaluated using the same 9-rule scoring methodology. The score reflects the nutritional quality of the food based on its ingredient list and guaranteed analysis - not price, brand reputation, or availability.

A score of 100 is the theoretical maximum. The higher the score, the better the food aligns with a cat's natural dietary needs.

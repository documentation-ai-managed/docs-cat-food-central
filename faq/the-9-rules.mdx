title: What are the 9 scoring rules?
description: >-
  The score is built from 9 specific rules - each targeting a different aspect
  of nutritional and ingredient quality. Rules can add or deduct points.
---
<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  The maximum attainable score is **100 points**. Most rules either add a bonus
  or apply a deduction - the final score is the sum of all 9 rules applied together.
</Callout>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Protein & Carbs">
    **Rule 1 - Carbohydrates**
    Points deducted based on dry matter carbohydrate percentage. The lower the
    carbs, the less the deduction.

    **Rule 2 - Protein Amount**
    Points added or deducted based on dry matter protein percentage. The
    baseline is 50% - foods above this score better, below it score worse.

    **Rule 3 - Non-Meat Protein**
    If significant protein comes from plant sources (pea protein, corn gluten,
    soy isolate, etc.) points are deducted. Cats need animal protein - plant
    protein doesn't deliver the same nutritional value for obligate carnivores.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Meat & Fat">
    **Rule 4 - Source of Meat and Fat**
    Named whole animal sources ("chicken", "salmon") score higher than vague
    or generic sources ("poultry fat", "animal meal"). By-products trigger
    deductions here.

    **Rule 6 - Additional Animal Protein**
    Bonus points when a food includes a second named animal protein source -
    adding nutritional diversity and reducing reliance on plant fillers.

    **Rule 7 - Meat Quality and Location**
    The specificity and position of meat ingredients in the ingredient list
    matters. Named, high-quality meats appearing early score better.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Additives & Minerals">
    **Rule 5 - Chemical Additives**
    Artificial preservatives (BHA, BHT, ethoxyquin), colors, and flavors
    trigger deductions. Natural preservation methods (mixed tocopherols,
    rosemary extract) do not.

    **Rule 8 - Natural Taurine**
    Taurine is essential for cats. Bonus points when it's provided naturally
    through high-quality animal ingredients rather than added synthetically.

    **Rule 9 - Chelated Minerals**
    Chelated minerals are bound to amino acids for better absorption. Foods
    using chelated forms over basic inorganic minerals earn bonus points.

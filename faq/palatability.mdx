title: Does the score factor in taste or palatability?
description: >-
  No - palatability is entirely outside the scoring methodology. A food can
  score very high and still be ignored by a picky cat.

  The score measures nutritional quality only. Whether a cat will enjoy eating a food is a completely separate question.
</Callout>

Palatability depends on fat coating, moisture level, kibble texture, aroma, and individual preference - none of which can be reliably measured from an ingredient list or guaranteed analysis.

In practice, some of the highest-scoring foods use minimal processing and fewer synthetic flavor enhancers, which can make them initially less appealing to cats conditioned to highly palatable kibble.

<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  If your cat refuses a high-scoring food, try a gradual transition - mix it
  with their current food, starting at about 25%, and increase over 7-10 days.
  Most cats adjust once they've had time to get used to the new taste and texture.

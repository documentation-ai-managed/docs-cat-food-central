title: What's NOT included in the score?
description: >-
  The score focuses purely on ingredients and nutrition. Several factors are
  intentionally excluded to keep the methodology objective and consistent across
  all products.
---
<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  Excluding these factors is a deliberate choice - not an oversight. The goal
  is a score that reflects nutritional quality consistently, regardless of
  external variables that vary by region, budget, or personal values.
</Callout>

<Expandable title="💰 Price" default-open="false">
  A budget food and a premium food with identical ingredients receive the same
  score. Whether that score is worth the price difference is a judgment only
  you can make.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="🏷️ Brand reputation or history" default-open="false">
  Past recalls, brand ownership, or company ethics are not factored in. The
  score reflects what's in the bag right now - not who made it or their track record.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="🌍 Country of origin or manufacturing location" default-open="false">
  Where a product is made or where ingredients are sourced from plays no part
  in the calculation. Two identical formulas from different countries score
  identically.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="🛒 Availability or distribution" default-open="false">
  Whether a product is sold at mass-market retailers or through specialty pet
  stores only has no bearing on the score.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="😋 Palatability and taste" default-open="false">
  How much cats enjoy eating a food can't be determined from an ingredient
  list. See [Palatability](/faq/palatability) for more on this.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="🥫 Wet food, raw, freeze-dried, or treats" default-open="false">
  The methodology was designed specifically for dry cat food. The nutritional
  benchmarks and rules don't translate directly to other formats.
</Expandable>

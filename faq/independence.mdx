description: >-
  Cat Food Central is an independent project built by a cat parent who wanted a
  truly objective way to evaluate dry cat foods - and couldn't find one.

  **No brand affiliations. No sponsored rankings. No paid placements.**
  Every score is generated by our methodology - not by who pays us.
</Callout>

## What "independent" means here

- **Not affiliated** with any pet food manufacturer, distributor, or retailer

- **No payment** can improve or alter a product's score

- **No brand** can purchase a higher position in search results or comparisons

- The scoring methodology is **publicly documented** - you can verify how every score is calculated

## How is the site funded?

Cat Food Central may use general advertising or affiliate links (e.g. links to buy a product). These have **zero influence on scores**. If that ever changes, we'll say so.

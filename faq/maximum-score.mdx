title: What's the highest score a cat food can get?
description: >-
  The theoretical maximum is 100 - representing a food that performs perfectly
  across all 9 rules. In practice, most dry cat foods score between 30 and 85.
---
<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  A score of 100 means: high animal protein, minimal carbs, named whole meat
  sources, no chemical additives, chelated minerals, and natural taurine. Very
  few commercially available dry foods achieve this.

## What score ranges mean in practice

<Columns cols="2">
  <Card title="🟢 70 - 100" horizontal="false">
    Strong nutritional profile. High animal protein, low carbs, quality
    ingredients. A great starting point for most healthy adult cats.
  </Card>

  <Card title="🟡 50 - 69" horizontal="false">
    Decent but with trade-offs - often higher carbs, some plant protein, or
    lower-quality fat sources. May work as a budget option or rotation food.
  </Card>

  <Card title="🔴 Below 50" horizontal="false">
    Significant nutritional compromises. High carbohydrates, heavy plant
    protein content, or problematic additives. Worth looking for an alternative
    where possible.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  A low score doesn't mean a food is harmful - it means it's less aligned with
  a cat's natural dietary needs. Always involve your vet before making
  significant changes to your cat's diet.
</Callout>

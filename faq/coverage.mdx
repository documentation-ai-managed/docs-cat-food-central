title: How many products does Cat Food Central cover?
description: >-
  Cat Food Central scores more than 1,400 dry cat foods from over 340 brands -
  and we're always adding more.
---
From widely available supermarket lines to specialty and premium options.\
We're continuously adding new products and updating existing ones when formulas change.

<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  **Coverage focuses on dry cat food only.** Wet food, raw food, freeze-dried, and treats
  are outside the current scope of the scoring methodology.

## How products are added

Products are added to the database through a combination of:

- Our own ongoing research and monitoring of new product releases

- Community suggestions from cat parents (that's you!)

- Formula update reports when a brand changes an existing recipe

## Can't find a product?

If a food you're looking for isn't in the database yet, you can suggest it. We'll review it and add it when we can.

## How do I know if the data is current?

Every product page shows when the data was last reviewed.\
If you spot a formula that's been updated but the score hasn't changed yet, please [report it](/faq/how-do-i-report-an-error) - community reports are one of the fastest ways we catch changes.

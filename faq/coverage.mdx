  **Dry cat food only.** Wet food, raw food, freeze-dried, and treats are outside the scope of the scoring methodology.
</Callout>

We're continuously adding new products and updating existing ones when formulas change.

## How products are added

- Our own ongoing research and monitoring of new releases

- Community suggestions from cat parents (that's you!)

- Formula update reports when a brand changes an existing recipe

## Can't find a product?

If a food you're looking for isn't in the database yet, you can suggest it. We'll review it and add it when we can.

→ [Suggest a product](/faq/suggest-product)

## How do I know if the data is current?

Every product page shows when the data was last reviewed. If you spot a formula that's been updated but the score hasn't changed yet, please [report it](/faq/product-feedback) - community reports are one of the fastest ways we catch changes.

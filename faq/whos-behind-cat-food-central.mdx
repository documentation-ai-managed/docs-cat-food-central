title: Who's behind Cat Food Central? Is it independent?
description: >-
  Cat Food Central is run independently, with no affiliation to any pet food
  brand, retailer, or manufacturer.
---
Cat Food Central is an independent project created by a cat owner who wanted a reliable, unbiased way to evaluate dry cat foods - and couldn't find one that was truly objective.

<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  **No brand affiliations. No sponsored rankings. No paid placements.**\
  The scores you see are generated entirely by our methodology - not by who pays us.
</Callout>

## What "independent" means here

- We are **not affiliated** with any pet food manufacturer, distributor, or retailer

- We do **not accept payment** to improve or alter a product's score

- No brand can **purchase a higher position** in search results or comparisons

- Our scoring methodology is **publicly documented,** so you can verify exactly how every score is calculated

## How is the site funded?

Cat Food Central may display general advertising or affiliate links (for example, links to purchase products). These commercial relationships have **zero influence on scores** - a product's score is determined solely by its ingredients and nutritional profile, full stop.

If that ever changes, we'll be transparent about it.

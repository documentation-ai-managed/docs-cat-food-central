title: How is the quality score calculated?
description: >-
  Every dry cat food is scored using the same 9-rule methodology - evaluating
  protein, carbohydrates, and ingredient quality against what cats actually need
  as obligate carnivores.
---
<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  The score is based **solely** on the ingredient list and guaranteed analysis
  of each product. Price, brand, availability, and palatability play no role.
</Callout>

The calculation happens in three stages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Convert to dry matter basis" title-type="p">
    All nutritional values are converted to dry matter basis (DMB) to strip out
    moisture content and make every product directly comparable - regardless of
    how the food was processed or preserved.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply the 9 scoring rules" title-type="p">
    Each rule adds or deducts points based on a specific aspect of the food -
    protein amount, carbohydrate level, ingredient sources, additives, mineral
    forms, and more. The same rules apply to every product, every time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Calculate the final score" title-type="p">
    Points are totalled into a final score out of 100. Most real-world products
    land between 30 and 85. A score in the 70s or above is considered strong
    for a dry cat food.
  </Step>
</Steps>

title: What are the 3 main scoring criteria?
description: >-
  Every score is built on three pillars: protein amount, carbohydrate amount,
  and the quality and source of ingredients.

<Columns cols="2">
  <Card title="🥩 Protein Amount" horizontal="false">
    Cats are obligate carnivores - they need animal protein to survive and
    thrive. Foods with higher protein content from animal sources score higher.
    The baseline is **50% dry matter protein**, reflecting a cat's natural diet.
  </Card>

  <Card title="🌾 Carbohydrate Amount" horizontal="false">
    Cats have no dietary requirement for carbohydrates and process them poorly.
    Lower carb content is always preferred. The baseline is **5% dry matter
    carbohydrates** - close to what a cat would consume in the wild.
  </Card>

  <Card title="⭐ Ingredient Quality" horizontal="false">
    Not all protein is equal. Whole named meat sources score higher than
    by-products, plant proteins, or unspecified meals. Fat sources, additives,
    and mineral forms are all evaluated here too.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  These three criteria work together. A food can have high total protein but
  still score poorly if most of that protein comes from plants rather than
  animal meat.
</Callout>

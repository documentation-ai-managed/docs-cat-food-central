title: Does a higher score mean it's the right food for my cat?
description: >-
  A higher score means better nutritional quality for cats in general - but the
  right food for your specific cat also depends on their individual health, age,
  and needs.
---
<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  The scoring system evaluates nutritional quality for cats as a species.
  It doesn't account for your individual cat's health conditions, life stage,
  or sensitivities. Always involve your vet in major dietary decisions.
</Callout>

## What the score does tell you

For a healthy adult cat with no special requirements, a higher score reliably means:

- More protein from animal sources

- Fewer unnecessary carbohydrates

- Better quality meat and fat ingredients

- Fewer artificial additives

- More bioavailable minerals

## What the score doesn't account for

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Life Stage">
    Kittens need more calories and specific nutrient ratios for growth.
    Senior cats may benefit from different protein levels or added joint
    support. The score is calibrated for adult cats and doesn't adjust
    for age.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Health Conditions">
    Cats with kidney disease, diabetes, urinary issues, IBD, or food
    allergies often need therapeutic or restricted diets. A high-scoring
    food may not be appropriate - and a lower-scoring prescription diet
    might be exactly right for them.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Preferences & Sensitivities">
    Some cats have intolerances to specific proteins or ingredients.
    A food can score highly and still cause issues for a particular cat.
    And if your cat won't eat it - the score is irrelevant.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  Use the score as a strong starting point for comparison - not as a final
  verdict. The best food is one that's nutritionally strong *and* works
  for your specific cat.
</Callout>

title: Why did my cat's food score lower than I expected?
description: >-
  Marketing claims and nutritional quality don't always align. Even foods
  labelled 'premium' or 'high protein' can score low for specific reasons.

<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  Each product page includes a score breakdown showing exactly which rules
  helped and which ones triggered deductions - so you can see precisely why
  a food scored the way it did.
</Callout>

The most common reasons a food scores lower than expected:

<Expandable title="🌿 Protein is partly plant-based" default-open="false">
  Ingredients like pea protein, corn gluten meal, or soy protein isolate inflate the overall protein percentage on the label - but cats can't use plant protein the way they use animal protein. Rule 3 deducts points for this, even when the total protein percentage looks high.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="🌾 Carbohydrates are higher than they appear" default-open="false">
  Carbohydrates aren't listed directly on the bag - they're calculated from the other nutrients. Many foods are marketed as "low carb" or "grain-free" still contain 30-40% dry matter carbohydrates once the maths is done.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="❓ The meat source is vague or generic" default-open="false">
  "Poultry meal" or "meat and bone meal" instead of "chicken meal" or "deboned salmon" signals lower ingredient quality and triggers deductions under Rules 4 and 7. Named sources are always better.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="🧪 Artificial additives are present" default-open="false">
  Artificial colors, flavors, or chemical preservatives like BHA, BHT, or ethoxyquin trigger Rule 5 deductions - even when the food performs well across other criteria.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="💊 Basic mineral forms used" default-open="false">
  Foods using inorganic mineral forms (zinc oxide, ferrous sulfate, etc.) Instead of chelated minerals, you miss out on the Rule 9 bonus. It's a smaller factor, but it adds up.
</Expandable>

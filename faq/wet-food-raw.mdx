title: Does this scoring system apply to wet food or raw diets?
description: >-
  No - the methodology was built specifically for dry cat food and doesn't
  translate to wet, raw, freeze-dried, or semi-moist formats.

<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  Cat Food Central currently covers **dry cat food only**. Wet food, raw
  diets, freeze-dried, and semi-moist products are not scored or listed.

## Why dry food only?

The 9-rule methodology was built around the nutritional benchmarks and ingredient patterns specific to dry (kibble) cat food. Three key reasons it doesn't extend to other formats:

<Expandable title="Moisture content changes all the maths" default-open="false">
  Wet food has a fundamentally different moisture baseline, which affects
  how protein and carbohydrate percentages are interpreted - even when
  converted to dry matter basis. The same thresholds that work for kibble
  would produce misleading scores for wet food.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Different ingredients and processing" default-open="false">
  Raw and freeze-dried foods have completely different ingredient profiles
  and processing methods. Applying the same rules would be like judging
  a fish by its ability to climb a tree.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Benchmarks were set for dry food" default-open="false">
  The baselines - 50% dry matter protein, 5% dry matter carbohydrates -
  reflect what's realistic and achievable in dry cat food specifically.
  Applying them to wet or raw food would make almost everything score
  near-perfect, which wouldn't help anyone compare products.
</Expandable>

<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  Many cat nutrition experts recommend incorporating wet food into a cat's
  diet for added hydration. If you feed both wet and dry, use Cat Food
  Central to find the best dry food component - and talk to your vet
  about overall diet balance.

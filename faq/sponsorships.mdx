title: Does Cat Food Central accept sponsorships or paid placements?
description: >-
  No. Scores and rankings are never influenced by commercial relationships. A
  brand cannot pay to improve its score.

<Callout kind="note" collapsed="false">
  **Full stop:** no sponsorship, no paid placement, no commercial relationship
  can change how a product is scored or where it appears in results.

## How does this differ from other comparison sites

Many comparison sites allow brands to pay for higher visibility - first in search results, featured in "best of" lists, or favorable scores in exchange for advertising. Cat Food Central does none of this.

What we *do* allow is general display advertising and affiliate purchase links. These are clearly commercial but have no connection to how products are scored or ordered. The two are completely separate.

## Verify it yourself

The scoring methodology is [fully documented](/intro-to-our-scoring-system). Every rule, every calculation, every point added or deducted is publicly explained. If a score ever seems off, you can check the methodology directly - or [report it,](/faq/product-feedback) and we'll look into it.

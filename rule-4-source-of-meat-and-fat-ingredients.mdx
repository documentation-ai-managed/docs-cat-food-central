title: 'Rule 4: Source of Meat and Fat Ingredients'
description: >-
  The source and quality of meat and fat ingredients play a crucial role in
  determining the overall quality of dry cat food.
---
This rule evaluates these sources and deducts points accordingly.

## Quality Factors for By-product Meat and Unknown Sources

1. **By-product Meat Quality Factor**: By-product meats, such as internal organs and intestines, are considered lower-quality protein sources compared to whole meats. They are assigned a quality factor of 1/4 or 0.25, meaning they are considered one-fourth as valuable as whole meat sources.

2. **Unknown Source Quality Factor**: When the source of the main meat or fat ingredient is not specified (e.g., "meat and meat derivatives," "animal fats," "vegetable oils"), the quality of these ingredients cannot be properly evaluated. This uncertainty leads to a deduction of points.

## Calculation of Points Deduction Based on Meat and Fat Ingredient Sources

1. **By-product Meat Quantity Factor**:

- By-product as the main meat ingredient: -1 (full deduction)

- Partial by-product as the main meat ingredient (e.g., "chicken and chicken by-product"): -1/2 (half deduction)

Points deducted = (Total dry matter protein %) × (By-product quantity factor) × (By-product quality factor)

Example: 34% protein, partial by-product meat meal
Points deducted = 34 × (-1/2) × (1/4) = -4.25 points

1. **By-product Supplement Meat Ingredient Location Impact**:

- By-product supplement meat ingredient at 2nd-3rd places: -4 points

- By-product supplement meat ingredient at 4th-5th places: -2 points

- By-product supplement meat ingredient at 6th-7th places: -1 point

1. **Unknown Source of Main Ingredients**:

- Unknown source of the main meat ingredient: -5 points

- Unknown source of the main fat ingredient: -3 points

## Explanation of the Impact of By-products on Food Quality

By-products, such as internal organs and intestines, are considered lower-quality sources of protein for cats for several reasons:

1. **Undefined Content**: By-products' exact composition and nutritional value can vary significantly, making it difficult to assess their quality and suitability for a cat's diet.

2. **Quality Control**: The quality control and processing methods for by-products are generally less stringent than those for whole meat sources, potentially leading to inconsistencies and contamination.

3. **Digestibility**: By-products are often less digestible for cats compared to whole meat sources, which can lead to nutrient malabsorption and digestive issues.

4. **Allergies and Intolerances**: Some cats may develop allergies or intolerances to certain by-products, particularly those derived from less common sources or processed under suboptimal conditions.

While by-products can contribute to the overall protein content of cat food, their lower quality and potential negative impacts on digestibility and health make them less desirable as the primary protein source. Whole meat sources, especially those from high-quality, named sources, are generally preferred for obligate carnivores like cats.

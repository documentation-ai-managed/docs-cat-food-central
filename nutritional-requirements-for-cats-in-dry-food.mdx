description: >-
  Cats have distinct nutritional needs that reflect their evolutionary diet.
  Based on current veterinary research, let's review the essential nutrients

## Protein and Amino Acids

Cats require higher protein levels than many other mammals, typically 30-45% of their diet on a dry matter basis. Essential amino acids for cats include:

- Taurine: Critical for heart function, vision, and reproduction

- Arginine: Necessary for ammonia detoxification

- Methionine and Cysteine: Important for pH balance and coat health

Deficiencies in these amino acids can lead to severe health issues, including dilated cardiomyopathy and retinal degeneration.

## Fats and Fatty Acids

Dietary fat should constitute 20-24% of a cat's diet on a dry matter basis. Cats have specific requirements for:

- Arachidonic acid: An essential fatty acid that cats cannot synthesize

- Linoleic acid: Necessary for skin and coat health

## Carbohydrates

While not strictly required, carbohydrates can be utilized for energy. However, cats have a limited ability to digest complex carbohydrates due to low levels of amylase.

## Vitamins

Key <a href="/can-cats-take-vitamins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vitamins</a> for feline health include:

- Vitamin A: Cats lack the enzyme to convert beta-carotene to retinol

- Vitamin D: Essential for calcium metabolism

- Niacin: Cats have a high requirement due to rapid catabolism

## Minerals

Essential minerals in feline nutrition include:

- Calcium and Phosphorus: Crucial for bone health, ideally in a 1.2:1 ratio

- Magnesium: Essential for enzyme function, but excess can contribute to urinary tract issues

## Hydration

Cats evolved to obtain much of their water from prey, leading to a low thirst drive. Adequate hydration is crucial for urinary tract health and overall well-being.

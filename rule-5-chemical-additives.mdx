description: >-
  This rule addresses the presence of potentially harmful chemical additives in
  dry cat foods and deducts points accordingly.

## Points Deduction for Harmful Chemical Additives

1. **BHT, BHA, and Ethoxyquin**: These synthetic antioxidants are commonly used as preservatives in pet foods to prevent fats from becoming rancid. However, they have been linked to potential health risks:

- If any of these additives (BHT, BHA, or Ethoxyquin) are present in the ingredients, 5 points are deducted from the food's score.

1. **Food Colors**: Artificial food colors are often added to pet foods for aesthetic purposes, but they provide no nutritional value and may pose health risks:

- If artificial food colors are listed in the ingredients, 2 points are deducted from the food's score.

## Explanation of the Potential Health Risks

### BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoluene)

BHT is a synthetic antioxidant commonly used as a preservative in pet foods to prevent fats from becoming rancid. It is often found in dry cat foods that contain a significant amount of fat or oil, such as animal fats, fish oils, or vegetable oils. Examples of ingredients that may contain BHT:

- Animal fat (preserved with BHT)

- Chicken fat (preserved with BHT)

- Fish oil (preserved with BHT)

- Vegetable oil (preserved with BHT)

### BHA (Butylated Hydroxyanisole)

BHA is another synthetic antioxidant used as a preservative in pet foods, similar to BHT. It is often found in dry cat foods that contain a significant amount of fat or oils, as well as in treats and other pet products that require fat preservation. Examples of ingredients that may contain BHA:

- Poultry fat (preserved with BHA)

- Beef fat (preserved with BHA)

- Rendered animal fat (preserved with BHA)

- Vegetable oil (preserved with BHA)

### Ethoxyquin

Ethoxyquin is a synthetic antioxidant used as a preservative in pet foods, particularly in fish-based ingredients. It is commonly found in dry cat foods that contain fish meal, fish oil, or other fish-derived ingredients. Examples of ingredients that may contain Ethoxyquin:

- Fish meal (preserved with Ethoxyquin)

- Fish oil (preserved with Ethoxyquin)

- Herring meal (preserved with Ethoxyquin)

- Salmon meal (preserved with Ethoxyquin)

- These synthetic antioxidants have been associated with potential carcinogenic effects, liver and kidney toxicity, and other adverse health effects in animal studies.

- While the levels used in pet foods are generally considered safe, there are concerns about long-term exposure and the cumulative effects of these additives, especially for cats with compromised liver or kidney function.

### Artificial Food Colors

Artificial food colors are synthetic dyes added to pet foods for aesthetic purposes, such as making the food more visually appealing or distinguishing different flavors. These colors provide no nutritional value and may pose potential health risks. Examples of artificial food colors commonly found in pet foods:

- FD\&C Red No. 40

- FD\&C Yellow No. 5

- FD\&C Yellow No. 6

- FD\&C Blue No. 1

- Artificial food colors have been linked to various health issues, including allergic reactions, hyperactivity in children (although the evidence in pets is limited), and potential carcinogenic effects.

- These additives provide no nutritional value and are solely used for aesthetic purposes, making their inclusion in pet foods questionable.

Many pet food manufacturers have started to move away from using these synthetic additives. Instead, they opt for natural preservatives and antioxidants, such as vitamin E, rosemary extract, and citric acid. These natural alternatives are generally considered safer and more suitable for pet foods.

It is important to note that while the potential health risks of these additives are a concern, their actual impact on individual cats may vary depending on factors such as the amount consumed, the duration of exposure, and the cat's overall health status. However, minimizing these synthetic additives in cat foods is generally recommended as a precautionary measure.

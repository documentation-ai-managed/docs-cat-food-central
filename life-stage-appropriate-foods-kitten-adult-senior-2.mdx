Just like humans, cats have different dietary requirements at various stages of their lives:

## Kitten Food

Kittens are bundles of energy, and their bodies are rapidly growing and developing. During this crucial stage, they require a protein-rich diet, calories, and essential nutrients to support their growth and development.
Kitten foods are formulated with higher protein, fat, and calorie levels than adult cat foods.

Key features of kitten food:

High protein content (minimum 30% on a dry matter basis) for muscle development
Increased calorie density to meet their high energy demands
Optimal levels of calcium and phosphorus for proper bone growth
Adequate amounts of essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals

It's recommended that kittens be fed a high-quality kitten formula until they reach around 12 months of age or when they reach their adult weight, whichever comes first.

## Adult Cat Food

Once your cat reaches adulthood, their nutritional needs shift. Adult cat foods are designed to maintain their overall health and provide the necessary nutrients for an active lifestyle.

Characteristics of adult cat food:

Moderate protein levels (around 25-30% on a dry matter basis) for muscle maintenance
Balanced fat content for energy and essential fatty acid requirements
Appropriate levels of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants for immune system support

Adult cats can be fed a high-quality adult cat food formula from around 12 months of age until they reach their senior years, typically around 7-10 years old.

## Senior Cat Food

As cats age, their metabolism slows down, and their nutritional needs change once again. Senior cat foods are formulated to address the specific requirements of older felines, such as weight management, joint health, and digestive support.

Key features of senior cat food:

Slightly lower protein levels to reduce stress on aging kidneys
Increased fiber content for improved digestion and hairball management
Antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids for cognitive function and joint support
Controlled calorie density to prevent obesity, a common issue in senior cats

It's generally recommended that your cat transition to a senior formula around the age of 7-10, depending on its breed and individual needs.
